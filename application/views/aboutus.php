			<strong>TOMMYJAMS, REVOLUTIONISING LIVE ENTERTAINMENT</strong><br />
			<br />
			TommyJams is an initiative to collect artists and venues, and provide a transparent, hassle-free
			and inexpensive web-platform for them to interact. At TommyJams, we believe that there is a huge
			potential in the creative works of the artists of India. In our effort to showcase their talent,
			we provide a service to match the right artists with the right venues.<br />
			<br />
			We aim to build a community of artists, venues and fans, where booking and attending performances
			in cities across India is made as easy as possible, through a user-friendly web technology. Venues
			can launch their events online and book interested artists to perform, in just a few seconds, and
			fans get to stay tuned with all the events happening in their city and get closer to their favorite
			artists and venues.<br />
			<br />
			We plan to build and support a flexible yet credible DIY culture where the works of our artists
			reach out to as many people as possible, breaking boundaries of distance and time with the help
			of technology. Join us in our effort to see your city grow a little more vibrant and lively.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>THE TOMMYJAMS STORY</strong><br />
			<br />
			TommyJams was born in a Stanford University program, where Parth M. Saxena and Nikhil Kapur came up
			with an idea of combining two of their dearest passions of technology and music.<br />
			<br />
			After working on the conceptualization, design and development of the concept, they went out to
			conduct an extensive market research on the present live event scenario in India. They realized the
			lack of footfall in venues, the plethora of upcoming music talent in the country and the cumbersome
			process in booking gigs. Their strong technical backgrounds, and exposure into the music and live
			event industries, helped them get the precise solution for the problem that existed. It was about
			time to bring this talent into limelight.<br />
			<br />
			Soon, their passion overtook their day-to-day lives. They decided to quit their jobs at Texas Instruments
			and Microsoft, and devote all their time to build TommyJams. The initiative has received an overwhelming
			response in its early stages, and is now setting out to grow to a whole new level.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>OUR VISION</strong><br />
			<br />
			We observe a tremendous boost in development of India's live entertainment scenario. The number of artists
			is growing at an unimaginable pace. Fans are willing to explore new forms of music and art. Venues are
			organizing more frequent live events to welcome visitors. However, even with all the boom in the industry,
			the environment is still chaotic, messy and fragile.<br />
			<br />
			An initiative like TommyJams can help bring together this rapidly growing scenario in an organized way.
			With a technological system in place, booking and organizing live events across cities would become a
			simple and easy procedure to follow for anyone who is interested. Moreover, a healthy community would help
			the artists and venues to promote their talent among like-minded people and reach out to a wider audience,
			who would love the flood of music and art around them, and also contribute to the same in their own way.<br /></p>
